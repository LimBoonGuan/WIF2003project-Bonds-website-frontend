# WIF2003project-Bonds-website-frontend
This is a 7-person group project for my faculty course WIF2003 Web Programming.
This project only consists of the front-end. The back-end will be added at a later date.

Bonds is a online condominium management system where residents can check for latest information, manage visitor request, manage COVID-19 status, and check for facilities nearby. The admin view is the website is also available.
